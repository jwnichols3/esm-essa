		<p>The SiteMesh users' forum is a place you can ask questions and discuss ideas with other users
		and the development team.</p>

		<h3>Web access</h3>

		<p>The easiest way to join the forums is through our <a href="#">web based interface</a>.

		<h3>E-Mail subscription</h3>

		<p>If you are using the forums a lot, it is recommended you <a href="#">subscribe</a>.</p>

		<h3>Guidelines</h3>

		<p>To save yourself time, before posting a message, it is best to look out for an existing answer:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="#">User's guide</a></li>
			<li><a href="faq.jsp">Frequently asked questions</a></li>
			<li><a href="./">User's guide</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.google.com/">Elsewhere</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Developer's forums</h3>

		<p>There is also a dedicated <a href="../developers/forums.jsp">developers' forum</a> where the
		SiteMesh team discuss the development of the product.</p>

		 Developers meet and discuss project details at the SiteMesh Developer Forums. Anyone is invited to participate in these forums with development-related questions, ideas, and comments. These include:

		    * Patches
		    * Feature requests
		    * Non user-facing questions (development related)
		    * Suggestions
		    * Offers for help

If your message to the team isn't development-related, but you still want the development team to see it, don't worry: the User Forums is also monitored by the entire development team. And if you are unsure of where to post your message, use the User Forums as it will offer the widest audience to provide feedback and help.
