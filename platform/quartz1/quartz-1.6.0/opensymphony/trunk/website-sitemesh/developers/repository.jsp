    <h2>Browsing CVS</h2>

    SiteMesh CVS is hosted by java.net. You can view the source
    <a href="https://xwork.dev.java.net/source/browse/sitemesh/">here</a>.


    <h2>Anonymous Access</h2>

    java.net does not provide CVS access without first <a href="https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/Join">signing up</a>
    for a java.net user account. Once you have done this, you can get the source by doing the following:

    <div class="source">

        <pre>cvs -d :pserver:[username]@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs login
cvs -d :pserver:[username]@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs checkout sitemesh</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Developer Access</h2>

    Developers can check out CVS the same way as Anonymous Access. However, they cannot
    commit code until they are granted the <b>Developer</b> role in java.net.
    <p/>

    See <a href="contribute.action">How to Contribute</a> to learn how you can get
    involved with sitemesh and possibly gain developer access.

    <h2>Commit Messages</h2>

    You can monitor the CVS commit messages at the
    <a href="http://forums.opensymphony.com/forum.jspa?forumID=8">SiteMesh CVS Forums</a>.
    Alternatively, if you prefer email notifications, you can
    <a href="http://sitemesh.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=cvs">sign up</a> for the CVS mailing list.
