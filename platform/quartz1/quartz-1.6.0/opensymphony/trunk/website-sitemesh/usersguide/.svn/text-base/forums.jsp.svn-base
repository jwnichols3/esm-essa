		<p>Any SiteMesh-related question can be submitted at the SiteMesh User Forums. Anyone is invited to participate in these forums with user-related questions and comments. These include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Bug reports</li>
			<li>&quot;How to&quot; questions</li>
			<li>Best practices</li>
			<li>Other questions or ideas not addressed by the documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			We highly encourage you to <a href="./">consult the documentation</a> before posting any questions -- often your questions can be answered there. We also suggest <a href="http://forums.opensymphony.com/forum.jspa?forumID=3">searching the forums archives</a>, as it's likely that someone else may have already answered the question.
		</p>
