    </head>

    <body>

    Contributing doesn't always mean having CVS commit access. In fact, some of the
    best open source contributors never have CVS commit access. In order for
    <ww:property value="name"/> to be successful, we rely on help in many areas other
    than writing software. These include:
    <p/>

    <ul>
        <li>Submitting bug reports (<i>with patches!</i>)</li>
        <li>Writing documentation (<i>esp. based on common issues in the forums</i>)</li>
        <li>Helping out in the forums</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recognition</h2>
    We recognize people who help out in any way by adding their name as a Contributor to
    the <a href="members.action">Development Team</a>. Every person listed there has helped
    in some way, big or small, to make <ww:property value="name"/> what it is today. Without
    them, the project certainly would not be the same. With that said, we know that some
    people are especially interested in writing software...

    <h2>Becoming a developer</h2>
    Becoming a developer for <ww:property value="name"/> is on an invite-only basis. The
    project leaders look for people who have submitted bug reports (with patches),
    helped out with writing documentation, and stay active in the community forums. In
    addition to all these, developers must demonstrate a strong desire to see the project
    be succesful. This is typically done by staying in touch with the project leaders,
    following up on reported bugs, and generally offering assistance.
    <p/>

    developer, submit a request for the "Developer" role
    <a href="https://<ww:property value="id"/>.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMemberList">here</a>.
