        <title>What Is OpenSymphony?</title> 
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>OpenSymphony is a Java <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open 
        source</a> project (<a href="/license.jsp">license</a>) designed to
        provide application developers with a suite of <a 
        href="/components.jsp">components</a> for rapid development of
        enterprise class Java applications. These <a 
        href="/components.jsp">components</a> are loosely coupled, allowing the
        application developer to use one or more of them in a single application 
        (along with other 3rd party or custom components).</p>

        <h3>Why use OpenSymphony? </h3>

        <p>There are many out-of-the-box solutions or application frameworks
        available that aim to offer similar features, however OpenSymphony
        emphasises on the fact that every project has custom needs, and every
        team has preferred design practises. Many products force you into
        learning a customised framework, which does not integrate with other
        systems you have been using in the past or (more importantly) will be
        using in the future. OpenSymphony can happily co-exist with other
        components and frameworks - you can use even the smallest part of
        OpenSymphony in your existing applications with ease.</p>

        <h3>What platform does it run on? </h3>

        <p>OpenSymphony is built upon the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/overview.html">J2EE platform</a> - all
        components are pure Java. All OpenSymphony components strive to be
        platform, database and application server independent.</p>

        <h3>How usable is it? </h3>

        <p>Most <a href="/components.jsp">OpenSymphony components</a> have
        stable releases and are being maintained for several years (check each
        component's pages for details). OpenSymphony does not try to reinvent
        functionality that is solved by other products - if a suitable solution
        already exists, we try to reuse the functionality (license permitting).
        Wherever possible, we'll loosely couple 3rd party products so developers
        can plug in another product if they so desire.</p>

        <h3>Who writes it? </h3>

        <p>The <a href="/team.jsp">OpenSymphony team</a> has come together over
        the last 5 year and is made up of software professionals from around the
        world. Some have joined and brought their own components to the table,
        others have just brought their brains. We're proud to be able to say we
        have a truly global development team and we're always looking for new
        members.</p>
