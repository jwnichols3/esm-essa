Getting involved with OpenSymphony is easy: just email us on the mailing lists or 
forums and we'll work with you on how to best capture your willingness to help out.
Because OpenSymphony is a loose collection of projects, you'll need to get invovled
with each project individually. You can do so by <a href="/team.jsp">contacting</a> 
the project leaders, or by posting your ideas on the 
<a href="http://forums.opensymphony.com">forums</a>.
<p/>

The best way to get involved is to put your money where you mouth is -- by contributing
code! Providing patches with your bug reports will definitely get them resolved sooner
and will certainly lead to getting you on board as a developer for the project. We also
greatly appreciate:
