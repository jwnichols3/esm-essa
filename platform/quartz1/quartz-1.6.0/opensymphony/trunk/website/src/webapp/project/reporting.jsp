    You can find <ww:property value="name"/>'s issue tracker <a href="<ww:property value="jiraUrl"/>/browse/<ww:property value="jiraName"/>">here</a>.
    Before reporting any bugs, please check do your proper homework:
    <p/>

    <ol>
        <li>Check the <a href="documentation.action">documentation</a></li>
        <li>Search the issue tracker for duplicate bugs</li>
        <li>Search the <a href="userForums.action">forums</a> to see if your problem is answered there</li>
    </ol>

    Please remember that it takes a lot of time to go through issue lists, and every duplicate bug report takes that
    much more time before a release can be made. We highly encourage you to report bugs, as that only makes
    <ww:property value="name"/> better.
    <p/>

    However, we also ask you to help us by doing the proper research before asking
    for help or reporting an issue. If you do feel you've found an issue, we ask that you provide the any following information:
    <p/>

    <ul>
        <li>Version of <ww:property value="name"/></li>
        <li>Application server (if there is one) and version</li>
        <li>Version of Java</li>
        <li>Operating System</li>
        <li>Any relevant logs (in the form of attachments)</li>
        <li>Screenshots</li>
        <li>The most basic code that demonstrates the problem (please don't attach your entire application)</li>
    </ul>
