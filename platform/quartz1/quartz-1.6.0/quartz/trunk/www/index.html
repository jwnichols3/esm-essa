	  <p>Quartz is an open source, job scheduler for integration with stand-alone java applications and full-scale J2EE applications. Advanced features include clustering and participation in container managed transactions.</p>

<p>Quartz aims to be light-weight, scalable, and easy to use within your own applications.</p>

<p>It is in heavy use by hundreds (perhaps thousands) of developers, and is included in several other commercial and open source products.</p>

<p>The Quartz Project home page can be found at: <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com">OpenSymphony</a>, so most of the documentation and other resources relating to Quartz can still only be found at the original <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz">Open Symphony.</a>.</p>
