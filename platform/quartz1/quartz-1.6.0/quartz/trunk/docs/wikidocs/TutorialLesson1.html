<p>Before you can use the scheduler, it needs to be instantiated (who'd have guessed?). To do this, you use a SchedulerFactory. Some users of Quartz may keep an instance of a factory serialized in a JNDI store, others may find it just as easy (or easier) to instantiate and use a factory instance directly (such as in the example below).</p>

<p>Once a scheduler is instantiated, it can be started, placed in stand-by mode, and shutdown. Note that once a scheduler is shutdown, it cannot be restarted without being re-instantiated. Triggers do not fire (jobs do not execute) until the scheduler has been started, nor while it is in the paused state.</p>

<p>Here's a quick snippet of code, that instantiates and starts a scheduler, and schedules a job for execution:</p>

<div class="code"><div class="codeHeader"><b>Using Quartz</b></div><div class="codeContent">
<pre class="code-java">SchedulerFactory schedFact = <span class="code-keyword">new</span> org.quartz.impl.StdSchedulerFactory();

  Scheduler sched = schedFact.getScheduler();

  sched.start();

  JobDetail jobDetail = <span class="code-keyword">new</span> JobDetail(<span class="code-quote">"myJob"</span>,
                                      <span class="code-keyword">null</span>,
                                      DumbJob.class);

  Trigger trigger = TriggerUtils.makeHourlyTrigger(); <span class="code-comment">// fire every hour
</span>  trigger.setStartTime(TriggerUtils.getEvenHourDate(<span class="code-keyword">new</span> Date()));  <span class="code-comment">// start on the next even hour
</span>  trigger.setName(<span class="code-quote">"myTrigger"</span>);

  sched.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger);</pre>
</div></div>

<p>As you can see, working with quartz is rather simple. In <a href="TutorialLesson2.html" title="TutorialLesson2">Lesson 2</a> we'll give a quick overview of Jobs and Triggers, so that you can more fully understand this example.</p>
